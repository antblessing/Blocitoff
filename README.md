## Blocitoff:
A Ruby on Rails app that tracks items on your to-do list.  If after 24 hours the item is not complete, it will automatically be destroyed because it was not important enough!

## Features:
- Takes advantage of automatic rake tasks.
- Uses the devise gem for user authentication.
- Profiles of other users are visible to put more pressure on them, therefore encouraging completeness of their list.
